# HufffmanTest

## Usage
```
python3 testGen.py [Number of Tests] *Optional*[msan/asan/nosan] *Optional*[Minumum Length of Characters] *Optional*[Maximum Length of Characters] *Optional*[Unicode: Y/N]
```

## Whats Tested
- Building a minimum encoding size huffman tree from a text file of ascii & unicode characters (also tests your counter ADT)
- encoding a text file from that huffman tree within 5 seconds
- decoding the encoded data using a huffman tree within 5 seconds

## To Know
This testing phase requires all tasks to be completed.
When conducting longer length and unicode tests it is not necessarily your program that takes the entire time, it may be their minimum encoding problem to verify
